	/**
	 * The `Encryption` class provides methods for encrypting and decrypting data using AES-128-GCM encryption.
	 * It includes utilities for handling encryption keys, encrypting/decrypting data as `Uint8Array`, and converting
	 * encrypted/decrypted data to and from strings.
	 *
	 * ### Methods:
	 * - `getKey`: Retrieves the encryption key from the environment variable `CMS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
	 * - `encrypt`: Encrypts a `Uint8Array` using AES-128-GCM and returns the encrypted data.
	 * - `encryptToString`: Encrypts a string and returns the encrypted data as a `Uint8Array`.
	 * - `decrypt`: Decrypts a `Uint8Array` encrypted with AES-128-GCM and returns the decrypted data.
	 * - `decryptToString`: Decrypts a `Uint8Array` and returns the decrypted data as a string.
	 *
	 * ### Encryption Details:
	 * - The encryption algorithm used is `aes-128-gcm`.
	 * - The encrypted data includes the initialization vector (IV), the encrypted content, and the authentication tag.
	 * - The IV is randomly generated for each encryption operation.
	 *
	 * ### Error Handling:
	 * - The `decrypt` method throws an error if the encrypted data is less than 33 bytes.
	 *
	 * ### Dependencies:
	 * - `Effect`: A utility for managing asynchronous effects.
	 * - `pipeLogger` and `genLogger`: Logging utilities for tracing method calls.
	 * - `DynamicBuffer`: A utility for dynamically managing byte buffers.
	 * - `crypto`: Used for generating random values and creating cipher/decipher instances.

	/**
	 * The `Password` class provides methods for hashing passwords, verifying password hashes,
	 * and checking the strength of passwords. It includes functionality for ensuring passwords
	 * meet security standards, such as length requirements, avoiding unsafe passwords, and
	 * checking against the pwned password database.
	 *
	 * ### Methods:
	 * - `hashPassword`: Hashes a plain text password using a secure algorithm.
	 * - `verifyPasswordHash`: Verifies if a plain text password matches a hashed password.
	 * - `verifyPasswordStrength`: Checks if a password meets strength requirements, including
	 *   length, safety, and absence from the pwned password database.
	 *
	 * ### Dependencies:
	 * - `Scrypt`: Used for password hashing.
	 * - `CheckIfUnsafe`: Used to check if a password is a commonly known unsafe password.
	 * - `FetchHttpClient`: Used for making HTTP requests to external services, such as the
	 *   pwned password database API.
	 *
	 * ### Notes:
	 * - The `legacy0HashPassword` function is marked as deprecated and should not be used in
	 *   new implementations.
	 * - The `constantTimeEqual` function ensures secure string comparison to prevent timing
	 *   attacks.

	/**
	 * The `Session` class provides a set of methods for managing user sessions, including
	 * creating, validating, and invalidating sessions, as well as handling session cookies.
	 *
	 * This class is built using the `Effect.Service` pattern and relies on the `SDKCore`
	 * dependency for database interactions. It includes utility functions for generating
	 * session tokens, managing expiration dates, and interacting with session-related
	 * cookies in an API context.
	 *
	 * ### Methods:
	 * - `generateSessionToken`: Generates a random session token using base32 encoding.
	 * - `makeExpirationDate`: Creates a new expiration date for a session.
	 * - `createSession`: Creates a new session for a user and stores it in the database.
	 * - `validateSessionToken`: Validates a session token, extending its expiration if valid
	 *   or deleting it if expired.
	 * - `invalidateSession`: Deletes a session from the database by its ID.
	 * - `setSessionTokenCookie`: Sets a session token cookie in the provided API context.
	 * - `deleteSessionTokenCookie`: Deletes the session token cookie by setting it with an
	 *   empty value and a max age of 0.
	 * - `setOAuthSessionTokenCookie`: Sets an OAuth session token cookie in the given API context.
	 * - `createUserSession`: Creates a new user session, including generating a token, storing
	 *   it in the database, and setting a cookie.
	 *
	 * ### Dependencies:
	 * - `SDKCore`: Provides access to the database operations for session management.
	 *
	 * ### Usage:
	 * This class is designed to be used in the context of a web application where user
	 * authentication and session management are required. It provides a robust and
	 * extensible framework for handling session-related operations.

	/**
	 * The `User` class provides a set of methods and utilities for managing user authentication,
	 * user data, and permissions within the StudioCMS application. It includes functionality for:
